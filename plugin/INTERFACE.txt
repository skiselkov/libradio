*** libradio plugin interfacing HOWTO ***
*****************************************

libradio exposes 5 radios by default:

    "nav1" is the first combined NAV and DME radio
    "nav2" is the second combined NAV and DME radio
    "dme1" is a standalone DME-only radio
    "adf1" is the first ADF radio
    "adf2" is the second ADF radio

libradio automatically follows X-Plane's frequency tuning for the
respective radio by reading the following datarefs:

    sim/cockpit2/radios/actuators/nav1_frequency_hz - tunes "nav1"
    sim/cockpit2/radios/actuators/nav2_frequency_hz - tunes "nav2"
    sim/cockpit2/radios/actuators/dme_frequency_hz - tunes "dme1"
    sim/cockpit2/radios/actuators/adf1_frequency_hz - tunes "adf1"
    sim/cockpit2/radios/actuators/adf2_frequency_hz - tunes "adf2"

For each of these radios, you can read the details of the signal levels.
Each radio can receive multiple navaids at the same time. libradio gives
you signal levels for the top 16 navaids within a 300 NM radius.

    libradio/<radio>/navaid{0-15}/type		type: int
	This is the respective navaid type. The type is one of the
	following possible values:
	    1	- NDB
	    2	- VOR
	    4	- Localizer
	    8	- Glideslope
	    16	- Marker (unused)
	    32	- DME
	    64	- Final Path Alignment Point (unused)
	    128	- Landing Threshold Point (unused)
	    256	- GLS ground station (unused)

    libradio/<radio>/navaid{0-15}/id		type: up to 12 bytes
	This is the identifier of the originating station. This really is
	meant for debugging purposes and doesn't imply that the station can
	be received. The identifier is returned as NUL-terminated string.

    libradio/<radio>/navaid{0-15}/signal_db	type: float
	The signal intensity from the respective station in dBmW. This will
	most typically be a negative value. Values greater than -50 dB are
	usually excellent signal quality. Between -50 dB and -70 dB signal
	quality and tracking accuracy slowly degrades from very good to poor.
	Below -70 dB, tracking will tend to become very erratic, and very
	slow, as libradio simulates the receiver having to filter a lot of
	noise being received. At around -80 dB, libradio simulates a loss of
	carrier, meaning, the signal is lost (CDI deflection not displaying,
	DME not reading any distance, etc.)

    libradio/<radio>/navaid{0-15}/propmode	type: int
	This is for debugging purposes and denotes the strongest signal
	propagation mode computed by the underlying Longley-Rice radio
	model. The possible values are:
	    -1:	unknown/no propagation mode computed
	    0:	direct line of sight
	    5:	single horizon, diffraction
	    6:	single horizon, tropospheric scattering
	    9:	double horizon, diffraction
	    10:	double horizon, tropospheric scattering

Example values:

    Here's what you would typically see for the "nav1" radio tuned
    to a VOR/DME:

    libradio/nav1/navaid0/type = 2
    libradio/nav1/navaid0/id = "IPA"
    libradio/nav1/navaid0/signal_db = -45.2
    libradio/nav1/navaid0/propmode = 0
    libradio/nav1/navaid1/type = 32
    libradio/nav1/navaid1/id = "IPA"
    libradio/nav1/navaid1/signal_db = -68.1
    libradio/nav1/navaid1/propmode = 5
    libradio/nav1/navaid3/type = 0
    libradio/nav1/navaid3/id = ""
    libradio/nav1/navaid3/signal_db = 0
    libradio/nav1/navaid3/propmode = -1
    ... (etc for remaining navaid slots) ...

    Notice that each transmission type (VOR and DME) is represented as a
    separate navaid with its own signal strength and propagation mode.
    When trying to determine the actual received signal strength, you
    should only look for navaids of the appropriate "type" you are
    interested in, then look at the "signal_db" values. Don't expect that
    simply because you can receive the VHF VOR signal from a VOR/DME
    station, that you will also be able to receive the DME. Due to
    different wavelengths and propagation properties, some signals may be
    available for a given station, while others may not.

    Please also note that simply having a high signal strength doesn't
    guarantee reception. libradio simulates radio garble, in case there
    are multiple signals being received on the same type and frequency
    with similar strengths. If no single signal is sufficiently stronger
    than the others to "punch above the noise", then libradio will
    simulate the receiver not being able to "lock on" to any single
    station. Even more complicated, for example, you might be able to
    receive the VOR portion of one station, while the DME portion of a
    completely different station is more powerful and therefore "masking"
    the DME signal of the station sending the VOR signal. While these
    situations are rare and usually real-world facility planning tries to
    avoid these, they are nevertheless occasionally possible. This
    situation can most typically be seen when flying at high altitude and
    listening to localizers in an area with many airports. Due to the
    limited number of localizer frequencies available, it's possible to
    get localizer signal garble or LOC/DME guidance mismatch. This is why
    pilots are taught not to try to capture a localizer from too far
    away.

| Output Datarefs |
+-----------------+

By default, libradio overrides and takes control of the following default
radio navigation datarefs:

    ==================
    === NAV radios ===
    ==================

    sim/operation/override/override_nav1_needles:
    sim/operation/override/override_nav2_needles:
	Permanently set to '1'.

    sim/cockpit/radios/nav1_dir_degt:
    sim/cockpit/radios/nav2_dir_degt:
	Driven from the "nav1" and "nav2" radio VOR or LOC signal.

    sim/cockpit/radios/nav1_slope_degt:
    sim/cockpit/radios/nav2_slope_degt:
	Driven from the "nav2" and "nav2" radio Glideslope signal.

    sim/cockpit/radios/nav1_fromto:
    sim/cockpit/radios/nav2_fromto:
	Driven from the "nav1" and "nav2" radio VOR radial information
	and the respective "nav{1,2}_obs_deg_mag_pilot" dataref setting.
	Undefined value when the radio is tuned to a localizer.

    sim/cockpit/radios/nav1_fromto2:
    sim/cockpit/radios/nav2_fromto2:
	Same as sim/cockpit/radios/nav{1,2}_fromto, except the from/to flag
	is computed from the "nav{1,2}_obs_deg_mag_copilot" dataref.

    sim/cockpit/radios/nav1_hdef_dot:
    sim/cockpit/radios/nav2_hdef_dot:
	When the respective NAV radio is tuned to a VOR, this is set based
	on the relative difference between "nav{1,2}_obs_deg_mag_pilot"
	and the VOR radial being received. Full deflection (2 dots)
	corresponds to a 10 degree radial difference.
	When the respective NAV radio is tuned to a localizer, this is
	set based on simulated localizer DDM (which is determined
	geometrically from runway length, localizer antenna placement and
	other details specified in ICAO Annex 10). Please note that
	localizers DO NOT have a fixed beam angle. Rather, they are defined
	at the runway threshold in terms of a reference datum, and the
	actual course width depends on the distance between the reference
	datum and the localizer antenna. Full deflection (2 dots) is
	shown when localizer DDM reaches 0.155, as per ICAO Annex 10.

    sim/cockpit/radios/nav1_hdef_dot2:
    sim/cockpit/radios/nav2_hdef_dot2:
	Same as sim/cockpit/radios/nav{1,2}_hdef_dot, except for VORs,
	the CDI deflection is calculated from "nav{1,2}_obs_deg_mag_copilot".

    libradio/nav1/hdef_rate		[float]
    libradio/nav2/hdef_rate		[float]
	This is the rate at which the HDEF is changing in dots/s. Notice
	that this is independent of the cockpit instrumentation side. The
	value is simply computed from the underlying radial/s or DDM/s
	rate of change. This should help prevent derivative kick when the
	pilot changes their CDI course setting.

    sim/cockpit/radios/nav1_vdef_dot:
    sim/cockpit/radios/nav2_vdef_dot:
	Driven from the "nav1" and "nav2" radio glideslope signal. This is
	similar to the localizer signal, in that it is driven off the
	glideslope DDM, which is not of a fixed angular size. Instead, it
	is dependent upon the nominal glideslope centerline angle.

    sim/cockpit/radios/nav1_vdef_dot2:
    sim/cockpit/radios/nav2_vdef_dot2:
	Same as nav{1,2}_vdef_dot2.

    libradio/nav1/vdef_rate		[float]
    libradio/nav2/vdef_rate		[float]
	This is the rate at which the VDEF is changing in dots/s. The
	value is simply computed from the underlying glidepath DDM/s
	rate of change.

    libradio/nav1/have_vor_signal = 0|1	[bool]
    libradio/nav2/have_vor_signal = 0|1	[bool]
	These are set to '1' when the NAV receiver is sensing the VOR VHF
	carrier. The radial information might be extremely jittery at low
	signal levels though, so be sure to look at the signal strength
	as well.

    libradio/nav1/radial = 0-360	[float]
    libradio/nav2/radial = 0-360	[float]
	The raw radial information actually measured. Note that is really
	is the ONLY information sent out by a VOR. The CDI deflection is
	an entirely synthetic indication generated in a CDI instrument.

    libradio/nav1/radial		[float]
    libradio/nav2/radial		[float]
	This is the rate at which the VOR radial is changing in deg/s.

    libradio/nav1/have_loc_signal = 0|1	[bool]
    libradio/nav2/have_loc_signal = 0|1	[bool]
	These are set to '1' when the NAV receiver is sensing the localizer
	VHF carrier.

    libradio/nav1/loc_ddm		[float]
    libradio/nav2/loc_ddm		[float]
	This is the raw difference-in-depth-of-modulation value for the
	localizer VHF subcarriers. This is the only information actually
	received from a localizer. libradio simulates signal distortion at
	large angles from the localizer centerline, so don't trust the
	value much beyond the standard +-0.155 as defined by ICAO Annex 10.
	The signal is more-or-less linear only in this range. Beyond +-0.155,
	the angle-to-DDM relationship can be significantly non-linear.

    libradio/nav1/loc_ddm_rate		[float]
    libradio/nav2/loc_ddm_rate		[float]
	This is the rate at which the localizer DDM is changing in DDM/s.

    libradio/nav1/have_gp_signal = 0|1	[bool]
    libradio/nav2/have_gp_signal = 0|1	[bool]
	These are set to '1' when the NAV receiver is sensing the glidepath
	VHF carrier.

    libradio/nav1/gp_ddm		[float]
    libradio/nav2/gp_ddm		[float]
	This is the raw difference-in-depth-of-modulation value for the
	glidepath VHF subcarriers. This is the only information actually
	received for the glidepath. libradio simulates signal distortion
	at large angles away from nearly-on-path, as well as false
	reflected images at multiples of the nominal glidepath angle.

    libradio/nav1/gp_ddm_rate		[float]
    libradio/nav2/gp_ddm_rate		[float]
	This is the rate at which the glidepath DDM is changing in DDM/s.

    ==================
    === DME radios ===
    ==================

    sim/operation/override/override_dme:
	Permanently set to '1'.

    sim/cockpit2/radios/indicators/nav1_dme_distance_nm:
    sim/cockpit2/radios/indicators/nav2_dme_distance_nm:
	Distance output of the respective paired DME radio to the NAV radio.

    sim/cockpit2/radios/indicators/nav_dme_distance_nm:
	Distance output of the third standalone DME radio.

    ==================
    === ADF radios ===
    ==================

    sim/operation/override/override_adf:
	Permanently set to '1'.

    sim/cockpit/radios/adf1_dir_degt:
    sim/cockpit/radios/adf2_dir_degt:
	Relative bearing output of the respective ADF. This is driven
	off the NDB signals being received by the ADF.

    libradio/adf1/have_ndb_signal = 0|1	[bool]
    libradio/adf2/have_ndb_signal = 0|1	[bool]
	These are set to '1' when the ADF receiver sees what looks like
	an NDB signal carrier.
